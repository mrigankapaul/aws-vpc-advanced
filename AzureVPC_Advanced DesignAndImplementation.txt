Cloud Computing - Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing

Six Advantages and Benefits of Cloud Computing
    Trade capital expenses for variable expense
    Benefit from massive economies of scale
    Stop guessing capacity
    Increase speed and agility
    Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
    Go global in minutes

Choosing the regions -
    latency
    cost
    compliance
    service availability

Regions - Collection of availability zone (Data Center)

VPC



Instance types comprise varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. They give you the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix of resources for your applications. Each instance type includes one or more instance sizes, which allows you to scale your resources to the requirements of your target workload.

security groups are attached to the ENI
Subnet could be only in one availability zone
ENI can be one and only one availability zone
Instance can be one and only one availability zone
Route Table can be only associated with more than one subnet
Route Table Can have one or more routes
Route consists of a destination subnet address and a target(IGW or another ENI, instance, VPC peering connection)


ssh -i "ec2try.pem" ec2-user@99.79.92.176


VPC peering connections limitationas
Inter region peering does not support IPv6
Peered VPCs must not have overlapping IP CIDR blocks
An instance in one VPC cannot use the IGW in a peered VPC or 


Transit VPC 
    - Minimize number of VPN connections
    - Avoids limitations of VPC peering

Steps to create www1 in web-vpc
1. Create VPC - 10.1.0.0/16
2. Create Subnet - 10.1.254.0/24
3. Create Route Table -  Subnet Associations - Associate with Subnet - Router is assigned an address of 10.1.254.1
4. Create IGW - Attach to VPC
5. In the Route Table - destination address(0.0.0.0/0) - IGW (Internet access)
6. Create a security group - Inbound Rules - SSH - My ID, HTTP - Anywhere
7. Elastic Network Interface - 10.1.254.10 - security group
8  Allocate Elastic IPs -  Associate Address - Resource Type -> Netwrok Interface that was created. And the private IP
9. Instances - Netwrok Interface - attach it to ENI.

Steps to create shared-vpc
1. Create VPC - 10.2.0.0/16
2. Create Subnet - 10.2.2.0/24 - database
3. Create Route Table -  Subnet Associations - Associate with Subnet
4. Instance - network interface (10.2.2.41) -> security group  
            ssh - 192.168.0.0/16, 10.2.0.0/16 Internal SSH or on prem
            MySQL 10.1.254.0/24 - web-pub subnet

VPC peering
1. Create Peering connection RequesterVPC - web-vpc Acceptor VPC - shared-vpc - Accept Request to Peer
2. Route Table - (web-vpc) - (10.2.2.0/24) (Database subnet) -> PCX
3. Route Table - (shared-vpc) - (10.1.254.0/24) (Database subnet) -> PCX

Egress only outbound access
    Configuring Routing for a NAT instance
        1. Create IGW - Attach to VPC
        2. Create Subnet - 10.2.254.0/24 -  Subnet Associations - Associate with Subnet 
        3. Route Tables - nat-pub  - Route 
                (0.0.0.0/0) - IGW(Internet Access), Subnet Association - nat-pub subnet
        4. Instance - 
                Elastic IPs -  Allocate IPs and copy it
                Netwrok interface - 10.2.254.254
                Create a new security Group - 
                    SSH - From My Machine
                    All TCP - (10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16)
                    Disable source destination check from networking
        5.In shared route table hosting db instance provide a route 0.0.0.0/0 -> nat1 instance
